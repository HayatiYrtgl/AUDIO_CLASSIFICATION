# AUDIO_CLASSIFICATION
It's a clasification of voice of capuchine bird. I used tensorflow and keras libraries. In my opinion preprocessing part was a little bit confusing  

# Audio Processing Project

This project is a Python application that processes audio files, performing classification using a deep learning model.

## Usage

The basic steps of the project are as follows:

1. Connect to Google Drive and upload the necessary files.
2. Load and preprocess audio files.
3. Create, train, and evaluate a deep learning model.

The entire project is developed in the Colab environment and can be accessed through the [Colab Notebook link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o13vQPq6r46WuoqUmDDBdmEZeseRqThF).

## Requirements

To run the project, you need the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow IO
- ...

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib tensorflow_io
